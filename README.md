Real-Time Data Handling: All data collected through the app is securely stored in a MongoDB database for easy access and management.

### Technology Stack

+ Frontend: Built with React for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

+ Backend: Powered by Express.js, serving as the API layer for data handling.

+ Database: MongoDB is used for storing guest information, ensuring reliability and scalability.

### How It Works

Guests are presented with an inviting interface where they can fill out the RSVP form. Each guest can add details such as their name and age (for adults and children). At the group level, guests can indicate whether theyâ€™ll join the after-party and share any special requirements.
All submitted data is sent to a MongoDB database, making it easy to review the RSVP details.

This app was lovingly crafted to ensure the smooth organization of this special event. It is designed to be simple yet functional, making the RSVP process hassle-free for everyone involved.
